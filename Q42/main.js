//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
//magician names' array
var magicians = ["harry potter", "hermione", "ran wiesly"];
//making function to show magicians' names
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach(function (magic) { return console.log(magic); });
}
//function for adding 'make great' with each magician name
function makeGreat(magicians) {
    return magicians.map(function (name) { return "The great ".concat(name); });
}
//calling function to modify with makeGreat
var greatmagicians = makeGreat(magicians);
//printing magicians' names with TheGreat added with names in a list
show_magicians(greatmagicians);
