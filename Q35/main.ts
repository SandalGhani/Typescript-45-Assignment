//Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

let animals = ["cat", "dog", "goat"]

for(let animalzz of animals){
    console.log(`A ${animalzz} would make a great pet.`)
}

//adding a line outside for-loop
console.log("\nAny of these animals would make a great pet!");
