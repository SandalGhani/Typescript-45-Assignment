//Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
var alien_color = "green";
// Write an if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
//pass version
if (alien_color === "green") {
    console.log("Player just earned 5 points");
}
// Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
//fail version
if (alien_color === "blue") {
    console.log("Alien color is blue");
}
