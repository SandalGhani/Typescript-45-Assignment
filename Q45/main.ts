//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function car(manufacturer, model, ...moreOptions){
    let carObject = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model,
    };

    //adding additional options to the carObject
    moreOptions.forEach(option => {
        let [key, value] = option.split(":");
        carObject [key.trim()] = value.trim();
    });
    return carObject;
}

//calling function
let myCar = car("Honda", "Civic", "Color: black", "Year: 2024");

//printing to check, if all data stored correctly in carobject
console.log(myCar);
