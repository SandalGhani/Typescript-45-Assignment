//Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
//• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
//• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
var five = 5;
var ten = 10;
//Test 1
console.log("Testing if Five is equal to 5?");
console.log(five == 5);
//Test 2
console.log("\n Testing if ten is equal to 5?");
console.log(ten == 10);
//Test 3
console.log("\n Testing if ten is > five?");
console.log(ten > five);
//Test 4
console.log("\n Testing if five is not equal to ten");
console.log(five != ten);
//Test 5
console.log("\n Testing if ten is greater or equal to 5");
console.log(ten >= 5);
//Test 6
console.log("\n Testing if ten is less than five");
console.log(ten < five);
//Test 7
console.log("\n Testing if five is greater than 10");
console.log(five > 10);
//Test 8
console.log("\nTesting if five is not greater than 4");
console.log(!(five > 4));
//Test 9
console.log("\nTesting if ten is greater than 100");
console.log(ten > 100);
//Test 10
console.log("\nTesting if ten is not greater than five");
console.log(!(ten > five));
